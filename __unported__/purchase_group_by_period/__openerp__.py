Group Purchase Lines By Period
==============================
With this module installed, purchase order lines generated by procurements are grouped into several purchase orders
based on their date, instead of all being added to the first draft PO found for the same supplier and same address.

For each supplier, a grouping time frame is selected. Time frames can be expressed among:
- Day
- Week
- Fortnight
- Month

Depending on this time frame, the purchase order lines are grouped into one purchase order per time frame.
