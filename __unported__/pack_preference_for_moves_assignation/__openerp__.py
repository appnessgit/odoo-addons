Package preference for moves assignation
========================================
This modules overwrites removal strategies FIFO and LIFO. Stock moves are now forced to reserve all the quants in the
package of the first quant reserved (youngest or oldest, according to the removal strategy of the location), even if
the native preference should be given to another one.

It also reserves the quants which are not in a package or not in a lot first, if the given order implies to choose
between one of them.
