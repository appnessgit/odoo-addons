Stock Transfer Split by Pack
============================
This module will add a "Split in Pack" button in the stock transfer view next to the native "Split" button. This button
will open a pop-up window asking for a quantity and if we should create packs. The amount of the line will then be split
in multiple lines of the selected quantity and a pack will be created for these lines if the options was selected. The
remaining quantity, if any, will stay in the original line.

This module is largely inspired from Akretion & Odoo Community Association (OCA) stock_transfer_split_multi module.
