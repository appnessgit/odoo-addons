Purchase Planning Improved
==========================
This module implement the improved planning to the purchase module.

Improved planning concept
-------------------------
The improved planning is a standardization of planning management in Odoo based on the following concepts:

- A planning is made of several tasks linked together. Each task can happen only when all the previous tasks are done.
- Each task has two dates:

    - A due date which is the date before which the task is to be done at the latest. The due date is changed only when
      a major rescheduling occurs. It is calculated backwards, task by task, from the due date of rightmost task of the
      planning (which is usually the date at which we promised to deliver the product to the customer).
    - A planned date which is the date at which we imagine the task is going to be executed given the information we
      have now. The planned date should be changed each time we have a new information and should never be in the past
      (since we are today and the task is not done, we have the information that the task will be executed sometime from
      now, but not before). It is calculated forwards, task by task, from the task(s) currently in execution.
- When a task is done, the actual execution date and the planned date are the same, but the due date is unchanged.
- The only relevant way to measure whether the project is late or early is for each task to compare the due date and
  the planned date.
- Comparing the planned date with today's date gives a indication on the accuracy of the planning, not on whether we
  are late or early.

Improved planning applied to purchase
-------------------------------------
In the purchase module, the application of the improved planning concepts is the following:

- Tasks are purchase order lines and stock moves associated to goods receipts.
- Tasks links are links between purchase order lines and stock moves made by the procurement rules (buy)
- Purchase order lines are given a new field date called "date_required" which is the due date of the purchase order
  line.
- The "date_planned" field is the planned date of the receipt which is the date confirmed by the supplier.
- If a procurement is rescheduled, the "date_required" fields of its purchase order lines are also modified to reflect
  the new date.

Notes
-----
- This module depends on the stock_planning_improved module and interfaces with the other planning improved modules
  such as mrp.
- This module also depends on purchase_working_days module since no decent planning can be done without taking into
  account the working days.
