Action Top Buttons For Views
============================
This module enables action buttons to be put directly next to "Print" and "More" instead of having them necessarily
inside those menus.

Usage: set the usage to 'top_button' in an action that you have added to "Print" or "More" menus to have its button
directly displayed.
