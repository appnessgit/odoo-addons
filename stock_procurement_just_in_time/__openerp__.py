Stock Procurement Just-In-Time
==============================
Just-In-Time (JIT) is an inventory strategy companies employ to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving
goods only as they are needed in the production process, thereby reducing inventory costs.

This modules implements a new calculation method for minimum stock rules that creates procurements for products just
before they are needed instead of creating them at earliest.

This calculation is done for each minimum stock rule, in the stock location defined by the rule. The needs are defined
by the outgoing stock moves in "Waiting availability" or "Available" statuses. This implies that the outgoing moves are
confirmed beforehand, either by already confirmed manufacturing orders, by already confirmed sale orders or by a sales
forecast module that creates confirmed moves to represent future sales.

Notes
-----
- This module depends on stock_planning_improved and as such on stock_working_days, which means that all the scheduling
  is made based on working days.
- This module is best used when interfaced with purchase_procurement_just_in_time and/or mrp_procurement_just_in_time
  modules which add information and warnings to the operator for how to reschedule the purchase orders and production
  orders to manage just-in-time procurement.
